Using the [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/) Framework, we are developing a Torrent Tracker system, that could be easily integrated to other CakePHP applications.

# Introduction #

Torta-cakePHP has been originally design as an Torrent Tracker application that runs on top of the CakePHP Framework. This simple application will allow cake developers to easily incorporate a torrent tracking system to their current installation of CakePHP.

Our first step in port [PHPBTTracker+](http://phpbttrkplus.sourceforge.net/) into Cake by incorporating the basic "Torrent protocol" communications between the server and the clients. With a simple interface we allow the server to host/track torrent files on the web server, and also provide clients with the necessary information to download the files.

## General Information ##

At this point in time we are making the application available so that we can get other cake users to start testing it, and of course to get their input.
